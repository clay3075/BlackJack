# BlackJack
The blackjack game is created using c++ and the multimedia library known as SFML(2.2). The game is functional but I never got around to fully competing it. The code works but is by no means in its most elegant state. If anyone has recommendations or wants to take it and complete  t I would like to see the improvements.
